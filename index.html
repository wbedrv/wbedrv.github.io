                <h2>What is GIH</h2>
		<p>In case you live in your mother's basement and jerk off to illustrations of underage anime girls who are apparently over 100 years old, you've probably heard of the website called Livegore. The website is ran by <a href="https://www.livegore.com/user/are17" target="_blank">biased niggers and chinks</a> who would ban you upon a slightest inconvenience, the community is not any better either. In early 2023 me and Theo launched a mass phishing attack on livegore, managing to get over 100 users, and most notably hacking the user "fuckthelife" who had more than 50,000 points. After doing a little bit of research we had concluded that livegore was developed by a <a href="https://rbmedia.online/" target="_blank">website designing company in Africa</a>. Further more I had discovered a <a href="https://www.tenable.com/plugins/nessus/190347" target="_blank">stored XSS vulnerability in CKEditor</a></li> which was patched right after the below video was shared on livegore. GIH was founded in 2022 right after I was banned from the original Livegore Discord server.</p>
